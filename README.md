# Alura-Challenge-Encrypter
This project is a challenge proposed in the course of One-Oracle Next Education dictated by Alura Latam. 
The challenge consisted in a text encrypter and decrypter with the following rules: 
All the vowels should be converted to:

- e => enter
- i => imes
- a => ai
- o => ober
- u => ufat

I took inspiration in the [project](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3p5nEh7XUyB3n2bomjP/Alura-Challenge---Desaf%C3%ADo-1---L%C3%B3gica?node-id=0%3A1) that Alura showed, but I put my personal style in it

I hope you like it :D
